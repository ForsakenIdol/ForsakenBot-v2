# ForsakenBot v0.1

This is the second iteration of ForsakenBot, written in Python. The original was written in JavaScript. We develop within a virtual environment, to prevent packages from being installed globally, and so that we can work with a single package version at a time.

This bot runs in a virtual environment! Remember to load `source bot-venv/scripts/activate` before running the bot.
