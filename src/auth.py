All commands that begin with "-auth" will land here - this is mainly just Login/Logout and changing profile details, and only occurs in secure channels, i.e. DMs.
All commands that begin with "-site" will land here - this is mainly just getting profile details (Blogs and Comments) and can occur anywhere.
Users can interface directly with the MySQL 'dbwebsite' table in the server database provided that their server / guild nickname matches their username in the database.
